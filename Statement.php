			<h4> What We believe.</h4>
			
			 <p class="paragraphAligned">We believe in the absolute inspiration of the Holy Scriptures given by the

Holy Spirit without error, as He moved upon holy men of old.   <br/><br />

Furthermore, we believe that the church has NO authority to establish doctrine or practices contrary to those same Scriptures.<br/><br/>

We believe that man was made in the image of God and is the crown of creation. He is prior to salvation, by reason of the fall, spiritually depraved, and alienation from his Creator.<br/></br> 

We believe that Justification is by grace through faith in our Lord&apos;s sacrifice on Calvary and that no one is justified by keeping the law.<br/><br/>

 
<h4>All of God's people are to be buried and resurrected with Christ.</h4>

<p class="paragraphAligned">We believe that all of God's people are to be buried and resurrected with Christ through water baptism by immersion, following conversion.</p><br/>
<p class="paragraphAligned">We believe in the priesthood of the believer; that is to say, all people born of God have equal status before and direct access to their Lord.</p><br/>
 
<h4>The baptism of the Holy Spirit is an endowment of power.</h4>

<p class="paragraphAligned">We believe that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is an endowment of power subsequent to conversion,
given by God to anoint the believer for sanctification and evangelism.</p> </br> 
 
<h4>All Christians are called to a life of holiness.</h4>

	<p class="paragraphAligned">We believe that all Christians are called to a life of holiness, devotion to the lord and His service, that is priesthood of all believers. 1Pt. 2:10; Heb. 13:15. <br/></br> 

With regards to sexual behaviour, we believe in HETEROSEXUAL relationship between a natural man and natural woman within the confines of lawful matrimony.</p>
